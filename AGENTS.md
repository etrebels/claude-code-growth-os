# AGENTS.md — Claude Code Growth OS

Instructions for AI coding agents working on this repository. For project overview, conventions, and session protocol, see [CLAUDE.md](./CLAUDE.md).

## Purpose

This is a **public, generic growth-OS kit** built on Claude Code — a markdown + bash system for running marketing, sales, product, and retention as one motion. It ships as a reusable template. For Edwin's personal live-state (pipeline, customers, priorities), see `etrebels/langoptima-growth-os`.

No code. No build system. Markdown playbooks in `ops/`, rituals as slash commands in `.claude/commands/`, skills in `.claude/skills/`.

## Content Layers

| Layer | Lives in | Owner | Purpose |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Playbooks** | `ops/` | Daily routines (read/write) | *What's true now* — live pipeline, customers, priorities, log |
| **Rituals** | `.claude/commands/` | Human (invoke) | *How to run the day* — the recurring task the command executes |
| **Skills** | `.claude/skills/` | Human (invoke) / agent | *On-demand depth* — account health, outreach, meeting prep |
| **Rules** | `.claude/rules/` | Always-on | *How to behave safely* — CRM guardrails, to-do list spec |
| **Reference** | `docs/` | Human (read) | *Why this works* — methodology, operating model, connecting a CRM |

**Never mix layers.** Live values stay in `ops/`; templates and playbooks stay in `docs/`; reusable task logic stays in `.claude/commands/` or `.claude/skills/`.

## Key Conventions

### Generic by design
This kit ships with `<placeholder>` values for anything installation-specific (CRM endpoints, calendar IDs, field names). Wire the real values into `.claude/settings.local.json` (gitignored) or a private skill — never commit them here.

### No code
This is a markdown + bash system. Never create `.js`, `.ts`, `.json`, or `.html` files in `ops/`, `docs/`, or `.claude/commands/`. Shell scripts in `.claude/hooks/` and `.claude/scripts/` are the only non-markdown exception.

### Commit ops/ like code
`ops/` files are mutable state. Commit them often — `git log ops/` is the audit trail. Each routine writes ops/ and commits at end-of-run so tomorrow's session opens consistent.

### Rules are the single source of truth for their concern
A rule in `.claude/rules/` owns its domain. Commands and cloud routines point to the rule — they don't re-derive its logic. See `.claude/rules/README.md`.

### CRM lives in one lane
Deals → CRM (via MCP). Tasks → task tool. Priorities → `ops/priorities.md` (derived). Never create CRM tasks from a ritual — that forks the to-do list. See `.claude/rules/crm-usage.md`.

### To-do list has one canonical render spec
Every entry point (session start, each ritual, each cloud routine) uses the spec in `.claude/rules/todo-single-source.md`. Don't re-derive the grouping or filtering inside a command.

## Available Commands

| Command | Time | Role |
|---|---|---|
| `/morning-briefing` | 07:30 | Calendar + pipeline + Notion sync, pre-stages meeting prep |
| `/midday-checkin` | 14:00 | Action-item sweep, CRM persist (skips if in a meeting) |
| `/end-of-day` | 17:30 | Daily-log draft, tomorrow's Top 3, feedback-loop tags |
| `/weekly-review` | Friday | Pipeline reconcile, feedback-loop close, next week's priority |
| `/retention-report` | Monthly | NRR/GRR roll-up, churn by reason, next month's bets |
| `/demo-briefing` | Ad-hoc | Pre-meeting brief for a named prospect or deal |
| `/capture` | Ad-hoc | Capture-now, triage-later inbox |
| `/reconcile` | Ad-hoc | Catch drift across mirrored files (mirror-vs-CRM, log-vs-reality) |
| `/babysit-prs` | Ad-hoc/scheduled | Open-PR health check — CI, review comments, merge conflicts, stale-signal escalation |

## Hooks

| Hook | Event | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `session-start.sh` | **SessionStart** | Surface `ops/priorities.md` + latest `ops/feedback-log.md` signals |
| `pre-compact.sh` | **PreCompact** | Re-inject priorities + latest log entry before compaction |
| `protect-files.sh` | **PreToolUse (Edit\|Write)** | Block writes to `.env*`, `*.key`, `*.secret`, `*.token`, `credentials.*` |
| `stop-reminder.sh` | **Stop** | Nudge `/end-of-day` if today is not yet logged |
| `pre-commit-guard.sh` | git pre-commit | Block commits that contain likely secrets (install once: `bash .claude/hooks/pre-commit-guard.sh install`) |
| `web-bootstrap.sh` | **SessionStart** (cloud only) | Install `shellcheck` on cloud/web sessions; no-op locally |

## Scheduling

Three layers — run the rituals without your machine awake:

1. **Local** — cron (Linux) or launchd (macOS). Setup in `.claude/scheduling/README.md`.
2. **Cloud Routines** — Anthropic-hosted Claude Code sessions triggered on a schedule. Runbook in `.claude/scheduling/cloud-routines.md`.
3. **GitHub Actions CI backstop** — deterministic checks only (`.claude/scripts/checks/growth-os-checks.sh`).

## Source-of-Truth Hierarchy

1. **`.claude/rules/crm-usage.md`** — canonical for CRM access protocol and write guardrails
2. **`.claude/rules/todo-single-source.md`** — canonical for to-do list query and render spec
3. **`docs/operating-model.md`** — canonical for the bowtie model and six handoffs
4. **`docs/connecting-a-crm.md`** — canonical for CRM projection loop mechanics
5. **`CLAUDE.md`** — canonical for project conventions and session protocol
